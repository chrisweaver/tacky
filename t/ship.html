                Obviously ships can't sail into the wind. So how do they
                get back home? Is that why Columbus went to America -- because
                he didn't know how to turn around?
            </p>
            <p>
                No, it turns out ships can sail into the wind, a little.
                When pointed upwind, tightly-trimmed sails turn into an airfoil that
                suck ships forward. Most ships can sail up to 45 degrees into the wind,
                some even closer than that. So by alternating back and forth
                (see picture) ships can slowly work their way upwind. This
                maneuver is called "tacking".
            </p>

                That's where the expression "a change of tack" comes from. It's
                <i>not</i> "a change of tact" as many people say. That makes no
                sense. They are saying "let's stop being nice". Maybe they are
                confusing tact and tactics.
