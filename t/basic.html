                Brass tacks! Yes, that's where the saying comes from. Back in the goode olde days,
                cloth sellers nailed brass tacks on a countertop in precise one-yard increments.
                The vendor would stretch the cloth between the tacks before cutting it.
                That way, people could be sure they got what they paid for.

                Tacks are used in lots of places. Not just for hanging up pictures.
                You can find them in furniture and upholstery. Anywhere cheap crap can
                be found.
