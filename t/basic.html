                Thumb tacks. What most people think of when they think of tacks.
                You could say they have a ... one tack mind.

                Look, they even come in boxes. This one is kind of L-shaped. So it's a ... tack L-box.

                Brass tacks! Yes, that's where the saying comes from. Back in the goode olde days,
                cloth sellers nailed brass tacks on a countertop in precise one-yard increments.
                The vendor would stretch the cloth between the tacks before cutting it.
                That way, people could be sure they got what they paid for. Thus
                the tacks added value to the transaction. And yes, that's where that saying 
                comes from too. They were the first ... value added tacks.

                Tacks are used in lots of places. Not just for hanging up pictures.
                You can find them in cheap furniture and upholstery. Once you buy that
                bookcase or chair, it's yours. Your property. Which means you now have a
                lot of ... property tacks.

                OMG these are ugly. Wouldn't want to meet one in a dark alley. Could give someone
                a heart ... condition.
