                For people scared of pointy things, I guess, there's this stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faux tacks. Tack hacks. Tricky sticky. Pretender mender.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also useful if you must keep your office supplies in your carry-on,
                and you don't want a hassle from the TSA. Though it would look even
                more dangerous to anyone who watched one-too-many Mission Impossibles.
                Though here's a thought: since bombs always have flashing red lights
                (why is that, anyway? isn't it easier for spies and terrorists to make
                bombs without flashing lights and convenient countdown timers? I guess
                I know nothing about bomb-making) pack your alarm clock
                in your checked baggage if you must carry this stuff in your purse.
