                For people scared of pointy things, I guess, there's this stuff.

                Faux tacks. Tack hacks. Tricky sticky.

                Also useful if you must keep your office supplies in your carry-on,
                and you don't want a hassle from the TSA. Though it would look even
                more dangerous to anyone who watched one-too-many Mission Impossibles.
