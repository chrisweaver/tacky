                Tired of your tie flapping in your face? Sick of it 
                sopping up your soup? Scared of it strangling you when it's
                seized by a shredder? Tack it down!

                You can put your initial on your tie tack, though you will probably be
                the only person in the office with a tie tack, and probably the
                only person in the office with a tie. But since you already monogrammed
                your lapel, your handkerchief, your pen, your briefcase, and your neck
                with a tattoo that may be your initials or may be something off a
                Chinese menu, you might as well complete your sartorial narcissism.

                The guy at the mall said it was 14 karat gold with a diamond chip.
                On your tie it looks indistinguishable from brass and glass. The difference
                is on your credit card and that's where it counts.

                Google says this is a tie tack.
                I know better than to argue with Google.
