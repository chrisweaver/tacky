                Hard tack is made from flour, water, and salt. That's it.
                It's prized for its longevity, not for its flavor (it has none).
                Apparently the Romans had a version of it. And if you find one,
                it's probably just as edible as it ever was.

                The name "tack" comes from British sailor slang for "food".
                What is British sailor slang for "shattered molars"?
                Four out of five dentists recommend soaking hard tack in
                water before consumption. And then skipping the consumption.

                According to Wikipedia, during the American Civil War, soldiers would break
                up the hardtack and drop it into their morning coffee. This would not only soften
                the hardtack but any insects, mostly weevil larvae, would float to the top,
                and the soldiers could skim them off and resume eating. What a waste
                of good protein.
