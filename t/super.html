                The CCM company makes a brand of hockey skates called
                Super Tacks. I'm including them here because those were always my
                favorites. I think I still have a pair.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does that have to do with tacks? I wondered that too, so I did
                a little research. They were named after a bootmaker-turned-skatemaker
                named George Tackaberry who created his first Tacks skates over a hundred
                years ago. The brand name survived several company buyouts and mergers
                and is still going strong. Remarkable.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I guess they have nothing to do with tacks. Oh well.

            They make inlines too.
